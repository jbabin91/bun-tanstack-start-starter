# Documentation Overview

This folder collects higher-level reference material that complements the in-repo specs and code comments.

- [`getting-started.md`](./getting-started.md) covers environment setup, scripts, and editor tips.
- [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) explains routing, data fetching, styling, and runtime patterns.
- [`components.md`](./components.md) describes the UI primitives, composition rules, and accessibility expectations.

Each document should capture rationale alongside steps so readers understand why patterns exist, not just how to repeat them.
