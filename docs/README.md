# Documentation Overview

This folder collects higher-level reference material that complements the in-repo specs and code comments.

- `getting-started.md` (TBD) will outline environment setup, common scripts, and debugging tips.
- `architecture.md` (TBD) will record routing, data-fetching, and SSR conventions so new contributors see the big picture.
- `components.md` (TBD) will describe UI primitives, tokens, and composition patterns for the shadcn-inspired library.

Each document should capture rationale alongside steps so readers understand why patterns exist, not just how to repeat them.
