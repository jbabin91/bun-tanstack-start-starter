# TanStack Start Overview

TanStack Start is a full-stack framework that layers server rendering, routing, and server functions on top of TanStack Router and Vite. It keeps the client-first developer experience of TanStack Router but adds:

- **Full-document SSR + streaming** for fast first paint.
- **Server routes and server functions** for colocated API logic.
- **Type-safe routing** using the same file-based conventions from TanStack Router.
- **Bundler integration** (Vite) with automatic code splitting and hydration helpers.

Use TanStack Start when you need the convenience of a full-stack framework without giving up TanStack Router’s ergonomics or type safety.
